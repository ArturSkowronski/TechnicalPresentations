# DDD & Microservices: At Last, Some Boundaries! â€¢ Eric Evans

* Evans was advocate that every team should have his own datastore
* Evans don't like idea of perfections - team plan with architecture that need to rewrite whole world 
* Cattle not Cat - don't get fond to your software
* Microservices are important cause they challenge people to rethink their ways
* Context determine meaning of word
* Bounded context - context which encapsulate application
* Context Map - translation between contexts
* There is conformism in software
* Context Map don't is about direction of data - it is about the power
* Two conflicting conforming relationships are problematic
* If I conform to a mess
* You can't fix everything
* It's tempting to pierce through Boundaries - microservices make it unnecesary
